# ambient-noise-scatter-inversion
A method to map for ambient noise distribution from the precursors in ambient noise correlation. 
Include benchmark test in paper "Mapping the near-field scattered energy in sedimentary basins from ambient noise correlations" by Li, Clayton and Villa(2024).
Execute syn_test.mat in Matlab to run the tests directly. 
All files need to be kept in the same directory.
