# ambient-noise-scatterer-mapping
A method to map for ambient noise distribution from the precursors in ambient noise correlation. <br/>
Include benchmark test in paper "Mapping the near-field scattered energy in sedimentary basins from ambient noise correlations" by Li, Clayton and Villa(2024). <br/>
Execute syn_test.mat in Matlab to run the tests directly.  <br/>
All files need to be kept in the same directory. <br/>
